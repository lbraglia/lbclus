\title{Mean purity index}
\usage{
index_mean_purity(ref, cl)
}

Used in homework 1 to compare clustering solutions to a known classification
in a supervised approach: the index close to 1 suggest that clustering is
reproducing the reference/known classification better
}
\examples{
# oliveoil <- read.table("data/oliveoil.dat", header=TRUE)
head(oliveoil)
olive <- oliveoil[-c(1:2)]
cl <- kmeans(olive, 9)$cluster
